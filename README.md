# CodeWrapped
Spotify Wrapped but for your code? Yes please!!

In the spirit of Spotify Wrapped season, a fun plot showing the top five most used functions from my MSc thesis work.  This was inspired by [Nicola Rennie's blogpost]([https://pages.github.com/](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/2022-12-03-how-to-make-your-own-rstats-wrapped/)) and adjusted to show the total number of times each function was used.
